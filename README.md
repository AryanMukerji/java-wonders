What is Java?
In essence, Java is two things. First, Java is a programming and computing platform. Sun Microsystems first released it in 1995. Today, it is widely used in a variety of different websites. In fact, numerous applications and websites simply will not run unless you have Java installed.

Java is simpler to use than other programming languages, like C++, in part because it uses an object-oriented programming model. In object-oriented programming, concepts are represented as “objects” that have data fields and associated methods. In object-oriented programming, models called “objects” represent either a programming entity or an abstract project. Although, they are assembled independently of one another, all of these objects together form a whole piece of software. In Java, these “objects” are part of “classes” and they inherit the code common to the class. Object-oriented programming presents a number of different advantages. In particular, it reduces the likelihood of serious errors in codes. It also makes it easier to modify and maintain existing code. Overall, this code use and code recycling makes coding much more efficient.

In addition to a programming and computer platform, Java is also a program, or a “run-time environment” that you can install on any computer, smartphone, or mobile device in order to run Java-based applications.
